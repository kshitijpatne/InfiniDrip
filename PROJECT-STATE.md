# InfiniDrip — Project State

_Last updated: after Slice 18. Update this after every slice (and commit it WITH the code)._

## What it is
A lightweight, local 2D sewing-pattern designer in TypeScript. Type body
measurements → it drafts a real t-shirt pattern, renders it on a blueprint canvas
with seam allowances, notches, and grainlines, catches mistakes (guidance), lets
you pick a **target fit** and shows the exact gap to reach it, advises on ease from
fabric stretch, shows an assembled garment view with fabric colour, grades the
pattern into a size run (a tree-ring **nest**), auto-measures a **spec sheet**
across sizes, **estimates fabric usage** (a width-aware nesting layout with a
utilization read-out), runs a plain-English **production-readiness check** (one
pass/fail verdict), lets you **freeform-edit** a piece by dragging its points,
exports true-scale SVG + DXF + a tiled print-at-home PDF, and saves/loads your
work. Repo: github.com/kshitijpatne/InfiniDrip

## Stack & rules
TypeScript · SVG · Vite · Vitest (jsdom for UI). Strict TS, 100% coverage held
(build fails <95%). Pure functions everywhere except the thin UI layer. See
ARCHITECTURE.md for the layer map.

## Workflow
Build in numbered slices. Each: Claude verifies in its own env → delivers a
Claude Code prompt (new files full, existing files as surgical patches, verbatim
header) → gate is `npm run coverage` (expected test count + 100%) AND `npm run dev`
(feature visible) → commit + push. **Docs (this file, ARCHITECTURE.md,
SLICES-BRIEF.md) are committed in the same commit as the code they describe.**

## Slices done
1. geometry core (points, distance, Bézier + curve length)
2. drafting engine (measurements → t-shirt block)
3. render layer (pieces → blueprint SVG)
4. live measurement controls UI (58 tests)
5. guidance engine + sleeve-cap-fitted-to-armhole (72)
6. style suggester — current + nearby styles with cm deltas (82)
7. assembled garment view + fabric swatches (89)
8. seam allowance (cutting line) (94)
9. export layer — true-scale SVG + DXF cutting files, with Download buttons (103)
10. tiled PDF export — page-split + overlap + registration marks (119)
11. save/load — versioned JSON in localStorage, validated, with status feedback (139)
12. notches & grainlines — derived as rules on live pieces, grade for free (155)
13. ease/fabric guidance + prescriptive style target (171)
14. grading / size runs — re-draft over a size table → tree-ring nest; a Pattern /
    Size run view toggle (187)
15. tech pack (part 1) — auto-measured POM spec sheet across the size run, in a
    Spec view (202)
16. nesting / fabric estimator — width-aware shelf-pack of the cut pieces on a bolt,
    with a fabric-length + true (polygon-area) utilization read-out, in a Nesting
    view (219)
17. production-readiness checker — guidance grown into one pass/fail verdict
    (matched seams, cap ease, square-at-fold hem, notch/grain declared, size run
    grows), in a Check view (239)
18. freeform edit mode — drag a piece's vertices and curve controls to reshape it;
    edits are a manual override, Reset re-drafts from measurements; in an Edit view
    (257)

**Slice 13 note (design changed mid-build):** ease did NOT become an auto-applied
pre-draft transform. Instead: (a) **fabric/ease is guidance only** — the app
suggests an ease value from the fabric's stretch % and shows a plain-English note,
but the user owns the ease slider and dials it in by hand; nothing is written for
them. (b) The **style suggester became prescriptive** — you pick a target fit from
a dropdown and the panel shows the signed gap to it on every axis (e.g. "Ease +9
cm", "Length −13 cm"), confirming when you're there. Selecting a target changes no
measurement. This replaced the old descriptive "here are nearby styles" panel and
removed the redundancy between a separate Fit control and the style list.

**Slice 15 note (tech pack split into two passes):** the *measured heart* shipped
in Slice 15 — a POM spec sheet where each point of measure is a live geometry
query on named edges (`seam` length via `cubicLength`, `spanX`/`spanY` between
named points), run across the graded sizes so the table fills itself and grades
for free. The tech-pack *document* — a flat sketch with callout leaders, a PDF
doc writer on the export spine, and editable BOM/construction stubs — is a
deferred second pass (call it 15b), packaging around this core.

**Slice 16 note (rotation is inert, so it wasn't built):** for a grain-constrained
bounding-box pack, 0°/180°/mirror all yield the identical box and 90° tips the
grain sideways, so "grain-constrained rotation" cannot tighten this nest — real
savings need polygon (no-fit-polygon) nesting, which is out of scope. Nesting was
therefore shipped as an honest width-aware **shelf pack** (a sibling helper), and
the cutting-file exports were left on the existing translation-only `layoutPieces`
(rotating there would misplace SVG notches/grainlines, which are re-derived from
the original piece). Utilization uses true polygon area (shoelace), not the
bounding box, so it doesn't flatter the result.

**Slice 17 note (scoped to what a tee can honestly prove):** five real checks
shipped (seven rows). **Dart legs** and **smooth transitions** were left out (the
tee has no dart; smooth-transition is a fuzzy fit call, not a hard gate), and
right-angle-at-fold was scoped to the **hem** rather than the neckline (the shipped
neckline meets the fold on a vertical tangent by design — a checker slice shouldn't
retroactively flag intended geometry). Those arrive with the fitted/darted recipe.

**Slice 18 note (freeform vs. the parametric core):** freeform editing is the first
thing that stores geometry NOT derived from `measurements`. To protect the "one
source of truth" invariant it's quarantined: the Edit view snapshots the **front**,
edits are a manual override held only in the editor's state, they do **not** feed
back into measurements, and **Reset** re-drafts from the current measurements. The
reusable payload is a pure `moveHandle(piece, handle, to)` primitive — the exact
machinery dart manipulation (Slice 20) will rotate around an apex.

## Roadmap (what's left)
Ordering principle: **ride the export spine + pure engine first; defer the heavy
freeform editor until darts need it.** Dependency spine (✓ = done):
notches ✓ → ease ✓ → grading ✓ → tech pack ✓ (spec sheet; doc pass pending) →
nesting ✓ → checker ✓ → editor ✓ → fitted recipe → darts.

- **15b. Tech-pack document** (deferred second pass) — flat sketch with callout
  leaders + a PDF doc writer on the export spine + editable BOM/construction stubs.
  The measured spec sheet (Slice 15) feeds it directly.
- ✓ 16. Nesting / fabric estimator (done — width-aware shelf pack; a helper, not a marker)
- ✓ 17. Production-readiness checker (done — guidance rolled into one pass/fail verdict)
- ✓ 18. Freeform edit mode (done — drag vertices + curve controls; override, not parametric)
19. **Fitted/darted garment recipe** — first non-tee garment; introduces a real
    bust dart for the editor to operate on.
20. **Dart manipulation** — rotate/slash around the apex (conservation law:
    relocating a dart doesn't change fit). Needs the editor (18) + a darted recipe
    (19); the rotation **primitive** (pure, testable) can be built opportunistically
    earlier, on top of `moveHandle`.

Later: 2D body view → photo→pattern (Feature A) → upcycle planner (Feature B).

## Honest boundaries
Assembled view is a schematic, not a drape simulation. Photo features estimate
proportions (a photo has no scale) — "get close, then refine." Export files are in
centimetres (documented in code); the DXF is a minimal R12 (entities-only) — opens
clean (0 audit errors in ezdxf), but a picky tool may ask you to confirm "cm" on
import. The PDF is a minimal ASCII PDF-1.4 — opens in any PDF reader; 21 pages on
A4 for standard-M measurements (7 cols × 3 rows), tiles overlap 1 cm for taping.

Per feature (so we don't overclaim):
- **Ease**: guidance, not an auto-transform — the app *suggests* a value from the
  fabric's stretch % and explains it, but the user owns the ease number and dials
  it in manually. A heuristic, not drape physics.
- **Style**: prescriptive — you declare a target fit and the panel shows the gap on
  every axis; it never changes a measurement for you. The user closes the gaps.
- **Notches**: style is non-standardized — we pick one convention and document it;
  DXF notch representation may need a confirm on import (same caveat as our R12 DXF).
- **Save/Load**: persists measurements + fabric to localStorage (versioned JSON,
  bounds-validated); clears/migrates safely on a bad or wrong-version save.
- **Grading**: proportional re-draft around the user's measurements as base size,
  not editable grade-rule node-shifting; quality depends on the grade increments
  (the nest's tree-rings make a bad grade visible at a glance). Per-size *export*
  (downloading each size's cutting file) isn't built yet — a small follow-on on the
  existing export spine.
- **Tech pack**: the spec sheet auto-reads finished-garment measurements off the
  drafted geometry (front/back symmetric, so front stands in for the body); it's a
  credible measured spec, not a manufacturability guarantee. Tolerances, BOM, and
  how-to-measure are user-owned scaffolding, coming with the 15b document pass.
- **Nesting**: bounding-box / grain-constrained **shelf pack** only; no concave
  interlock (no no-fit-polygon), no rotation (inert under grain+bbox), plain fabric
  only (no nap/stripe/defect). It's an estimator and a layout helper, not a
  production marker. Don't quote efficiency vs commercial CAD.
- **Checker**: verifies **sewability (geometry)**, not fit — a muslin still decides
  fit. Knows intentional ease ≠ error (per the Slice 5 cap logic). Currently five
  checks (seven rows); dart-leg and smooth-transition checks land with a darted
  garment. Runs on the tee block; the checker *engine* is garment-agnostic.
- **Editor**: freeform drag of one piece (the **front**) — a manual override, not a
  parametric change. Edits don't write back to measurements and don't survive a
  Reset (which re-drafts). It ignores the fold constraint on purpose (freeform means
  freeform). It's the interaction gate for darts, not a full pattern CAD yet
  (single piece, no add/delete points, no undo history).
- **Darts**: geometrically faithful but fit still needs a muslin; the basic tee has
  no dart, so 20 is gated on a fitted recipe (19).

## Research context
Roadmap derives from a competitive landscape study (Seamly2D/Valentina,
Tailornova, Fabra, Knitup, Gerber/Lectra/Optitex). Closest technical analog:
Seamly2D. Closest mission analog: Tailornova. Differentiators we're leaning into:
parametric grading (nearly free given the engine), auto POM/tech-pack export,
fabric-aware ease guidance, and the plain-English production-readiness checker
(a positioning nobody else owns). Full per-feature rationale lives in the research
thread.
